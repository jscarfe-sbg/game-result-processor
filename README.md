# Game Result Processor (GRP)

The GRP (we love a 3 letter acronym at Skybet!) is a simple application which does the following:
1. Provides a HTTP endpoint to allow you to register a game result
2. Stores the game results 
3. Performs aggregations on the game results
4. Provides a HTTP endpoint to allow you to retrieve the aggregations and raw results
